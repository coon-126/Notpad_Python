Notepad Application
This application is a fully featured notepad editor built with Python and PyQt5. It supports file operations like creating a new file, opening an existing file, and saving files. The application has a multi-tab interface, allowing you to work with multiple files at the same time. It also features a status bar to show you the current file being worked on and the position of the cursor in the file. It comes with a light and dark theme switch for a customizable user experience.

Requirements
To run this application, you will need Python 3.6 or above and the PyQt5 library.
You can install Python from the official website:

https://www.python.org/

After Python is installed, you can install PyQt5 using pip, which is a package manager for Python.
Open your terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

pip install PyQt5

If you have both Python 2 and 3 installed in your system, you might need to use pip3 instead:

pip3 install PyQt5

That's it! You're now ready to run the application.

If you're having any issues, please check that you have a compatible version of Python installed, and that PyQt5 was successfully installed by running pip list or pip3 list.

Enjoy using the notepad application!
